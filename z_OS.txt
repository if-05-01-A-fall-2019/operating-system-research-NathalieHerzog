z/OS is a 64-bit OS developed by IBM.It`s described as an extremely scalable and secure high-performance operating system based on the
64-bit z/Architecture. z/OS lays claim to being highly reliable for running mission-critical applications. The operating system supports Java-based applications
and it can communicate directly via TCP/IP, including IPv6, and includes standard HTTP servers along with other common services such as 
FTP, NFS, and CIFS/SMB.

IBM's z/OS evolved from an operating system that could process a single program at a time to an operating system that can manage many 
multi-tenant mainframe applications, each runningin protected memory spaces and offering varied performance goals.

Mainframes with z/OS are typically used to run large, complex, mission-critical workloads for large enterprise organizations. Generally 
mainframes are well-suited for tasks involving large-scale transaction processing. They can handle thousands of simultaneous users and 
any applications accessing computing resources, manage databases in the terabyte size range and run busy high-bandwidth network
communication. Such workloads often include real-time order entry and processing, financial transactions, payroll, inventory control, 
manufacturing and production.

Some interesting features I found:
- z/OS has built-in support for Parallel Sysplex clustering
- nowadays it only runs in 64-bit mode, but application programmers can still use any addressing mode
- Generation Data Group (GDG) is a special type of file used by z/OS
